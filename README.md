# NDVI-Using-Satellite-Imagery

PROBLEM AT HAND
With evolving society and increasing urbanization and modernization, the earth is being transformed into a concrete jungle. 
This is at the expense of the vast forests being cut down everyday to make more space for the humans. 
Deforestation is a global issue which needs immediate attention and firm steps to combat it. The United Nations has conducted a study according to which, approximately 13 million hectares of forest land is lost each year, leading to 20 per cent increase in annual global greenhouse gas levels. 
Deforestation means preservation of natural forest to agriculture or timber farming, but selective logging is important for communities and shouldn't be considered deforestation. So now the question arises how to measure this deforestation to determine whether our natural reserves are being exploited or are being used at an optimum level. 

PROPOSED SOLUTION
Using an enhanced Change Detection method for the analysis of Satellite image based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI employs the Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing data technique to find Vegetation Index, land cover classification, vegetation, water bodies, open area, scrub area, hilly areas, agricultural area, thick forest, with various different band combinations of the remote sensed data.
Different type of Land Resources can be easily interpreted by computing their Index value for Land Cover classification. NDVI method is applicable with the help of its characteristic like vegetation at different NDVI threshold values such as 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4 and 0.5. The Simulation results show that the NDVI is highly useful in detecting the surface features of the visible area which are extremely beneficial for policy makers in decision making. Vegetation estimation is extremely beneficial in predicting unfortunate natural disasters, to provide humanitarian aid, damage assessment and mitigation, and furthermore to device damage control and prevention strategies. This would help the law makers and environmental conservatives  to effectively formulate laws and emphasize the practice of forestation  in the moribund areas.

SETTING UP THE SYSTEM
The following are required to run this project:
•	Rasterio:  It is a Geographic information systems that uses GeoTIFF format to organize and store gridded raster datasets such as satellite imagery and terrain models. Rasterio is a library which reads and writes such formats and provides a Python API based on Numpy N-dimensional arrays and GeoJSON.
•	Numpy: It is a library that is primarily used with Python programming language. It gives support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
•	Matplotlib: It is a plotting library especially beneficial for the Python programming language. It is primarily used in associations with its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
•	Requests : It might not need to if we already have miniconda installed. To install it use the following code. ‘$ pip install requests Requirement already satisfied: requests in /miniconda3/envs/…’ )
